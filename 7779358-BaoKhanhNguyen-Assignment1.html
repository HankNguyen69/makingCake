        <p class="para1">These seemingly small cakes can easily be shared between two, depending on your tolerance for richness. That said, diehard chocoholics will have no trouble devouring the lot. Choose your audience – and portioning – accordingly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>190 gm butter, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>190 gm dark chocolate (60%-68% cocoa solids), coarsely chopped</li>

            <li>40 gm Dutch-process cocoa</li>
            <li>¼ tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>90 gm (½ cup) coarsely chopped milk chocolate</li>
            <li>40 gm slivered or coarsely chopped pistachio nuts, plus extra finely chopped to serve Pistachio or vanilla ice-cream, to serve</li>

        <h1>FUDGE SAUCE</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>150 gm caster sugar</li>
            <li>170 gm dark chocolate (54%-58% cocoa solids), finely chopped</li>
            <li>140 gm liquid glucose</li>
            <li>20 gm Dutch-process cocoa, sifted</li>
            <li>20 gm butter, diced</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para2">1 Preheat oven to 180°C, and butter and flour eight 10cm-diameter cake tins.</p>
        <p>2 Melt butter and dark chocolate in a bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, stirring occasionally, until smooth (2-3 minutes). Remove from heat, add sugar, then mix in eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Sift flour, cocoa and baking powder over mixture, add a pinch of salt and stir until just combined (don’t overwork the mixture or the brownie will be cakey). Stir in milk chocolate and pistachio nuts, reserving a little of each to scatter on top.</p>
        <p> 3 Divide among prepared tins, smooth tops, scatter with reserved milk chocolate and slivers of pistachio nuts. Scatter with a little sea salt and bake until set around the edges but still a little fudgy in the centre (20-25 minutes; a skewer inserted should withdraw with just a little mixture on it). Cool in tins.</p>
        <p> 4 For fudge sauce, stir sugar, chocolate, glucose, cocoa, butter, 1 tsp sea salt and 150ml water in a saucepan over medium-high heat until smooth, bring to a simmer and cook until sauce has a light syrup consistency (3-4 minutes). Cool briefly.</p>
        <p> 5 To serve, top cakes with ice-cream, drizzle with warm fudge sauce and sprinkle with finely chopped pistachio nuts.</p>
