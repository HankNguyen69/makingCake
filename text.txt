Little brownie cakes with fudge sauce

MAKES 8 // PREP TIME 20 MINS // COOK 35 MINS (PLUS COOLING)

These seemingly small cakes can easily be shared between two, depending on your tolerance for richness. That said, diehard chocoholics will have no trouble devouring the lot. Choose your audience – and portioning – accordingly.

    190 gm butter, coarsely chopped
    190 gm dark chocolate (60%-68% cocoa solids), coarsely chopped
    210 gm brown sugar 3 eggs
    130 gm plain flour 40 gm Dutch-process cocoa ¼ tsp baking powder
    90 gm (½ cup) coarsely chopped milk chocolate
    40 gm slivered or coarsely chopped pistachio nuts, plus extra finely chopped to serve Pistachio or vanilla ice-cream, to serve

FUDGE SAUCE

    150 gm caster sugar
    170 gm dark chocolate (54%-58% cocoa solids), finely chopped
    140 gm liquid glucose
    20 gm Dutch-process cocoa, sifted
    20 gm butter, diced

    1 Preheat oven to 180°C, and butter and flour eight 10cm-diameter cake tins.

    2 Melt butter and dark chocolate in a bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, stirring occasionally, until smooth (2-3 minutes). Remove from heat, add sugar, then mix in eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Sift flour, cocoa and baking powder over mixture, add a pinch of salt and stir until just combined (don’t overwork the mixture or the brownie will be cakey). Stir in milk chocolate and pistachio nuts, reserving a little of each to scatter on top.
    3 Divide among prepared tins, smooth tops, scatter with reserved milk chocolate and slivers of pistachio nuts. Scatter with a little sea salt and bake until set around the edges but still a little fudgy in the centre (20-25 minutes; a skewer inserted should withdraw with just a little mixture on it). Cool in tins.
    4 For fudge sauce, stir sugar, chocolate, glucose, cocoa, butter, 1 tsp sea salt and 150ml water in a saucepan over medium-high heat until smooth, bring to a simmer and cook until sauce has a light syrup consistency (3-4 minutes). Cool briefly.
    5 To serve, top cakes with ice-cream, drizzle with warm fudge sauce and sprinkle with finely chopped pistachio nuts.
